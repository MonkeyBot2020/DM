<h2>DM</h2>
A virtual Dungeon Master (DM) bot for Dungeons & Dragons games on Slack. Can be included into threads, allows users to easily roll dice, make attack rolls, skill checks, store character information and more! I've used this for my own PbP games for nearly a year. It's updated regularly. 
</br></br>
<b>Relevant functions & abilities:</b>
<li>Threaded message inclusion: bot can be included into threaded messages, making dice rolls and skill checks a breeze</li>
<li>Intuitive & easy-to-use functions: players can use intuitive, fast commands to roll skill ckecks, saves and attacks</li>
<li>Initiative tracking & turn automation: DMs and players can track the turns, health, and effects of players and monsters alike in combat, with full-featured automation! Make an attack or cast a spell in a single command, and all saves, AC checks, and damage will be automatically resolved!</li>
<li>Store character information: relevant character abilities and stats can be stored easily using simple commands</li>
</br>
